## Features

### MVVM Architecture

- üîÅ **Model-View-ViewModel**: This architecture was chosen to separate logic and UI in order to enhance maintainability and scalability. The `SetGame` Model handles the game logic, the `SetGameView` View manages the UI and the `SetGameViewModel` ViewModel binds the View to the Model, interprets the Model on behalf of the View and communicates user intentions from the View to the Model.
